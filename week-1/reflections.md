## 1.1 Think About Time
The most interesting time management tool I read about this week was in “Make it Big by Starting Small,” and repeated in “Counterintuitive Productivity” (which I found to be the most helpful article: the idea of turning micro into macro instead of starting with a grand plan and filling it in piece by piece. I tend to be a global thinker, which can make large projects overwhelming, because I find it difficult to just work on one piece at a time, which is how we are taught in school to approach problems like that. I like the idea of treating each component as a discrete whole, and working from there.

I like “Time Boxing”: I think setting aside chunks of time to complete certain tasks is a good way of breaking down large projects for large-scale thinkers because it breaks the task down into a measurable unit. It also provides motivation: the Pomodoro technique, for instance, which is a method of time boxing, gives only 25 minutes (a challenge!) and then 5 minutes off (a reward! Coffee!) At the moment, because I’m working full-time and caring for three dogs, I’ve had trouble this week adapting to an extra schedule that fits around my work schedule. I felt like the “Counterintuitive Productivity” piece spoke very strongly to me: I have so little free time that it can be hard for me to convince myself to do extra work, even when the work ends up being something I enjoy (once I got started with the command line tutorial, I found myself wanting to do that more than turn on Netflix). But by setting challenging time limits and focusing on “flow” rather than a rigid list of tasks, I think I can tackle this. I also won’t be doing it alone; my accountability group and I will function to provide extra motivation to stay on track.

## 1.2 The Command Line
What is a shell? What is “bash?"
A shell is an application that is text-only. It translates text commands that humans write into programs that computers can read. Bash, which stands for “Bourne-again shell” is the most popular shell program, and the one I am using in OS.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
I found the “mv” command confusing—did it move a file or just rename it?—and ended up having to look up extra sources.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I went through all the ones in the resource! I’m sure there are a whole lot more that I don’t know and haven’t seen yet.
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
Right now, for me, pwd and ls, because the most confusing thing right now is knowing where I am.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - prints which directory you’re currently working in

-ls - lists all the contents of the working directory

-mv - this moves files to directories OR renames a file from one name to another

-cd - changes the working directory to a specified directory

-../ - moves up one step from the current directory

-touch - makes a new file in the current directory

-mkdir - makes a new directory

-less - lets you page through a file in the shell

-rmdir - deletes a (empty) directory

-rm - deletes a file

-help - shows a list of commands: to find more information about something on the list, you can type “help [command]”
