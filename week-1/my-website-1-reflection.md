Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository makes an empty repository in your account. You can do this in the GitHub user interface. Clicking the plus sign next to your avatar will pull up a drop-down menu from which you can select “new repository.” After you click this, you will be taken to a screen where you can name the repository and select its privacy settings and licenses, etc. Clicking “Create repository” will make a new repository, but that repository only exists on GitHub. To save it to your own computer, you have to clone it. You can clone it by copying the clone URL found along the right side of the page under “HTTPS clone URL”, and then opening your shell and typing “git clone [paste clone URL here]”.The repository has now been saved to your computer.

Describe what open source means.
"Open source" means that the source code--that is, the specific code that makes the program what it is--can be seen and edited by anyone.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Right now it makes me feel nervous just because I'm nervous every time I change code, and the idea of mucking up someone else's nice program that they made scares me. I think what I like the most about it right now is that if I can look at other people's complex, working code for real programs and apps, I can study it and better understand how to write my own.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
I never knew copyright was automatic in the US! As a writer, that makes me really happy. As a coding student, I'm glad that there are licenses that allow other people to help out with the code that is otherwise automatically copyrighted to me. As a future developer, I'm glad there are different kinds of licenses depending on what kind of help I might need.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I had a lot of trouble figuring out how the pull request worked in the previous challenge, especially how it impacted my local copy of the repository. It made a lot more sense in this challenge! I got stuck at one point trying to open my new repository because I forgot that it wasn't in the current working directory! I had to use ls to see where I was and then navigate upwards.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I ended up reading the GitHub help page on pull requests because I was having a hard time understanding them.
