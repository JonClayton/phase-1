<p> Version control is a way programmers can track changes in a program. Programs are often complex pieces of code with a lot of moving parts. It's easy to make mistakes and not always easy to find them. By using version control, programmers can get a better sense of where they went wrong when there is a bug, and they can also preserve a working, bug-free model to go back to. Git is a form of version-control software. By using commits, it allows "save points" in the code that you can fall back to if you make a mistake. It also allows branches, which can be worked on without affecting the main code, and then merged with the main ("master") branch of code when they are complete. </p>

<p>
GitHub is an online platform for git version control. Storing code on GitHub's servers backs it up and allows it to be edited by multiple people, who can make their own branches and then request to have them added back to the main code. By hosting code on servers, instead of on individual computers, the creation and editing process is made more collaborative.
