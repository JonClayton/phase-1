##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1. Information Gathering:
  - identify the purpose, goals, target audience, and content of the site
  - requires a solid understanding both of what the site is about (i.e. who it is created for), and what the developer wants out of the site.
2. Planning
  - make a site map based on the information gathered in phase 1: how will the site help accomplish the goals set? What is the best way for users to navigate the site?
  - decide which technologies will be used. Will the site use a content management system? How will contact information be handled? Are users buying things? How will they do this?
3. Design
  - determine the look and feel of the site: colors, fonts, etc., based on information about users and purpose gathered in phase 1
  - make a wireframe or wireframes for the site as design protoypes
4. Development
  - this is where HTML and CSS come in (if they have not already been used in the site prototype)
  - use HTML/CSS to make the site look like the agreed-upon design
  - CMS and e-commerce tools are also used at this time
5. Testing and Delivery
  - make sure the website works!
  - Are there broken links?
  - Is the code valid? Will it work on multiple browsers?
  - then upload the site to the server and run through it again.
  - Install necessary plugins
  - Search Engine Optimization: tweak the site to make it more visible to search engines so users will see your site first
6. Maintenance
  - The site has now been launched! Make sure it keeps working
  - update APIs and plugins as they are changed
  - add technology as needed
  - upgrade as needed
  - backup site regularly

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  - My site is meant to serve as an introduction for me to potential employers, roommates, romantic partners, and my parents, all of whom would like to know that I have useful skills.
  - My site's content will include information about me, contact details including LinkedIn and Github, and two portfolios: one of coding projects and one of my marketing and writing projects

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  - My target audience wants to know more about me, which is why they're on my website. My site will make available the kind of information I want available to the general public.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  - The visitor should be able to navigate quickly to whatever the pertinent information is: an employer should be able to find my portfolio and resume; potential roommates should be able to find my bio; my parents should be able to get to the front page and be impressed that I built a website and not worry about anything else.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  - Design is different from usability. Usability is how a user navigates a website; UX design is how a user feels about navigating a website.
  - A frustrated user is a lost customer! Good design makes the complex feel simple and elegant.
  - UX design should take the platform into account. Most people now access the internet via mobile, so a site that is not mobile-compatible is not a good site.
  - Design must take audience into account, both in terms of aesthetics and usability. Design will be very different for a tech-savvy audience than for an audience of web neophytes.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
 - UX design is making sure the the user interacts with the product in a way that is pleasing for them. It involves usability -- is the website easy to navigate? Do the links work? Does the site's design help or interfere with the performance? (e.g. an attractive e-commerce site is useless if the shoppers can't figure out how to pay for their shopping cart) as well as aesthetics - does the intended audience like this color scheme? Does it display well on mobile? A product should be accessible and pleasant to use. Audience must always be taken into account.
 - UX design is valuable because whatever the purpose of the website--whether to sell things, provide information, or gather data--a website that is appealing to its audience will always outperform a competing website of similar content with worse design.
 (This doesn't always mean "not ugly"--Craigslist is very popular, despite having almost no apparent design, because its interface works well for its users, not to mention it's free. A similarly ugly site or even a pretty site that is difficult to post on or navigate would not do so well.)

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I'm still having a slow time with going back and forth between git on my computer and Github, but I'm getting better with practice.
