#What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
#I had been doing a lot of pseudocode already. Sometimes it changes dramatically!

#What are the tradeoffs of using Arrays and Hashes for this challenge?
#We decided to use a hash because we wanted the extra layer of information that a hash could provide. Instead of having to access both the item and the quantity seperately, we could access and change both with the same line of code.
#What does a method return?
#A method returns the results of the most recent process.
#What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
#Any kind of variable
#How can you pass information between methods?
#You can make sure that information is accessible outside of the method by storing the method's result as a variable, and calling the next method on that result.
#What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
#Passing information without using classes makes a lot more sense now, and by corollary I feel more clear on the difference between local and instance variables.
